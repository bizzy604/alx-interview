## 0x03. Log Parsing

### Overview
This repository hosts the project "0x03. Log Parsing", which focuses on developing a Python script to parse and analyze log data from standard input (stdin). The script reads log lines in a specific format, computes metrics, and prints statistics periodically or upon keyboard interruption.

### Project Details
- **Project Duration:** Jun 18, 2024 6:00 AM - Jun 21, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Weight:** 1

### Project Requirements
- **Language:** Python
- **Tasks:** Implement a script that processes log data according to specified input formats and computes:
  - Total file size
  - Number of lines by HTTP status code (200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500)

### Concepts and Resources
To successfully complete the project, understanding and applying the following concepts is essential:
- File I/O in Python
- Signal Handling for keyboard interruption (CTRL + C)
- Data Processing including parsing, aggregating data, and using dictionaries
- Regular Expressions for validating input format
- Exception Handling in Python

### Repository Structure
- **Directory:** 0x03-log_parsing
- **File:** 0-stats.py

### Additional Resources
For further study and preparation, additional resources such as mock technical interviews and relevant Python documentation are recommended.

### Requirements
- **General:**
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - Execution environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.4.3
  - File endings: All files should end with a new line
  - Shebang: First line of scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - README.md: Mandatory, providing project overview and instructions
  - PEP 8 style: Code should adhere to PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
  - Executability: All scripts must be executable
  - File length: Tested using `wc`

### Conclusion
This project challenges Python programming skills in real-time data processing and is an opportunity to apply concepts like file handling, signal management, and data parsing. By completing this project, developers gain valuable experience in handling and analyzing log data effectively.
