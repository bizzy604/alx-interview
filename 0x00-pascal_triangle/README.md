# Summary of Pascal's Triangle Patterns

## Symmetry
Each row of Pascal's Triangle is symmetrical. The numbers read the same forwards and backwards.

## Binomial Coefficients
The elements in Pascal's Triangle represent the coefficients of the binomial expansion. For example, the elements in the nth row correspond to the coefficients of \((a+b)^n\).

## Sum of Rows
The sum of the elements in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle is \(2^n\). For example, the sum of the elements in the 3rd row \([1, 3, 3, 1]\) is \(2^3 = 8\).
